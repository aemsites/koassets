CURSOR AI SETUP - COPY/PASTE PROMPTS
========================================

STEP 1: SETUP JIRA MCP SERVER
------------------------------
Paste this prompt into Cursor (fill in YOUR_* values first):

---BEGIN PROMPT---
I want to set up an MCP server for my company's self-hosted JIRA instance that uses Personal Access Token (PAT) authentication.

Configuration details:
- JIRA Host: [YOUR_JIRA_HOST] (e.g., jira.yourcompany.com - without https://)
- My Email: [YOUR_EMAIL]
- Personal Access Token: [YOUR_JIRA_PAT]
- Project Key: [YOUR_PROJECT_KEY]

Requirements:
1. The server must use Bearer token authentication (not Basic Auth)
2. Use JIRA REST API v2 (our instance doesn't support v3)
3. Install in: ~/Documents/Cursor/mcp-servers/
4. Configure in ~/.cursor/mcp.json

Please:
1. Find or create an MCP server that works with self-hosted JIRA using PAT authentication
2. If needed, modify an existing community server to support Bearer tokens and API v2
3. Build and install it
4. Configure it in my mcp.json
5. Test the connection by fetching a JIRA issue I provide
---END PROMPT---


STEP 2: SETUP WIKI/CONFLUENCE MCP SERVER
-----------------------------------------
Paste this prompt into Cursor (fill in YOUR_* values first):

---BEGIN PROMPT---
I want to set up an MCP server for my company's self-hosted Confluence/Wiki instance that uses Personal Access Token (PAT) authentication.

Configuration details:
- Confluence Host: [YOUR_WIKI_HOST] (e.g., wiki.yourcompany.com - without https://)
- Personal Access Token: [YOUR_WIKI_PAT]

Requirements:
1. The server must use Bearer token authentication
2. Support self-hosted Confluence (not Atlassian Cloud)
3. Install in: ~/Documents/Cursor/mcp-servers/
4. Add to ~/.cursor/mcp.json alongside the JIRA server

MCP Tools needed:
- search-pages: Search using CQL
- get-page: Get page by ID
- get-page-by-title: Get page by space key and title
- list-spaces: List available spaces

Please:
1. Create a custom Confluence MCP server with these capabilities
2. Use TypeScript/Node.js
3. Build and install it
4. Configure it in my mcp.json
5. Test the connection by fetching a Wiki page I provide
---END PROMPT---


STEP 3: SETUP BROWSER DEBUGGING WORKFLOW
-----------------------------------------
Paste this prompt into Cursor (fill in YOUR_* values first):

---BEGIN PROMPT---
I want you to proactively use browser debugging tools during development without me having to provide console logs or screenshots manually.

Setup requirements:
- My local dev server runs at: [YOUR_LOCAL_URL] (e.g., http://localhost:3000)
- Stack components: [DESCRIBE YOUR STACK]

Workflow I want:
1. When I report a bug, automatically navigate to the page and capture:
   - Console errors, warnings, and logs
   - Network requests and API failures
   - Page snapshots to understand state
2. When implementing risky features, check the browser to verify functionality
3. When investigating issues, use browser tools to self-diagnose

Rules:
- Always remove debug statements and console.logs before production
- Use this automatically when: bugs reported, implementing features, investigating issues
- Make debugging faster by being self-sufficient instead of asking me for logs

Please:
1. Create a memory/rule for this debugging workflow
2. Test the browser connection to my local dev environment (when I start it)
3. Show me an example of automatic debugging in action
---END PROMPT---


STEP 4: TEST EVERYTHING
------------------------
After setup, paste this:

---BEGIN PROMPT---
Please verify all MCP servers and browser tools are working:

1. Test JIRA: Fetch issue [YOUR_ISSUE_KEY] (e.g., PROJ-123)
2. Test Wiki: Access page [YOUR_WIKI_PAGE_URL]
3. Test Browser: My dev server is running at [YOUR_LOCAL_URL] - please navigate, capture console, and check network requests

Summarize what's working and any issues found.
---END PROMPT---


QUICK REFERENCE: WHERE TO GET PAT TOKENS
=========================================

JIRA Personal Access Token:
1. Log into your JIRA instance
2. Click your profile picture → "Profile"
3. Go to "Personal Access Tokens" or "Account Settings" → "Security"
4. Click "Create token"
5. Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again)

Confluence/Wiki Personal Access Token:
1. Log into your Confluence instance
2. Click your profile picture → "Settings"
3. Go to "Personal Access Tokens"
4. Click "Create token"
5. Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again)


AFTER SETUP - RESTART CURSOR
=============================
After completing all steps, fully restart Cursor (quit and reopen) for MCP servers to load.


WHAT YOU CAN DO AFTER SETUP
============================

JIRA Examples:
- "Get details for issue PROJ-123"
- "Search for all open bugs"
- "Create a new story for feature X"

Wiki Examples:
- "Search for pages about authentication"
- "Get the API documentation page"
- "List all available Wiki spaces"

Browser Debugging:
- Just report bugs and AI will automatically check console/network
- AI will verify features work in browser
- Faster debugging without manual log sharing


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

MCP servers not connecting:
→ Restart Cursor completely
→ Check paths in mcp.json are absolute
→ Verify tokens haven't expired

Authentication fails:
→ Verify Bearer token format
→ Check API version (v2 for JIRA)
→ Test with curl first

Browser tools not working:
→ Ensure dev server is running
→ Check correct port/URL
→ Verify browser extension enabled in Cursor
