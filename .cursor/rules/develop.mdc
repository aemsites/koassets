The full stack inside this monorepo includes:

- Cloudflare worker inside the `cloudflare` folder
- Adobe Experience Manager EDS / Helix (https://aem.live) in the root folder, notably folders `scripts`, `styles`, `blocks`.
- React components for the search UI inside the `koassets-react` folder.
- The EDS content is not in this git repositoriy, but authored in DA: <https://da.live/#/aemsites/koassets>

To run and debug the full stack locally:

- The local development stack can be run using `npm run dev`. Stop with `Ctrl+C`.
- The server will be available at <http://localhost:8787>.
- It uses a cookie called `session` for authentication. Ask the developer for the cookie from their browser when making test requests from Cursor.
- More documentation in `README.md` under `Local development`.
